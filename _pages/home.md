excerpt: >
  I’m a recent master of science in geology/geochemistry and I’m looking forward to further developing my programming and broad tech background as part of answering and solving problems related to the earth and earth systems, especially if these forays include multispectral remote sensing/analysis, GIS tool automation and data engineering/pipelining.

    excerpt: "Put simply, I'd like to help make actionable the wealth of information that can be gleaned from wherever one has the will to point a camera, because I believe that the field of remote sensing will be the key to answering critical questions about our world in the coming years. <br />  
      This is a time when humanity's interest in the physical world has perhaps piqued, while satellite launch costs have plummeted, and alongside better cameras and sensors, improvements in circuit density have also yielded the compute power to make algorithmic processing of that data cheap and even ubiquitous! The ingestion and digestion of these data streams into a multitude of variables is something I'm highly interested to be part of. <br />  
        If this sounds like the kind of work that your company performs, please feel free to message me, even if it's just to talk shop!"

To those who speak Spanish:  
———————————————  
A los hispanoblantes:  
 Aún, no diría que tengo la idioma avanzada, pero sin embargo, cada día progreso y al fin y al cabo, puedo explicarme en más or menos palabras. Sería un gran placer si podría combinar mi experiencia en las geociencias con este amor de mi, Español, y ganar experiencia en este idioma con ustedes, mucho menos la oportunidad de trabaja en una puesta así.  Espero que puede encontrar uso para este gringo y doy un bienvenido a poder conversar con usted.
